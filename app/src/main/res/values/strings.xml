    <string name="help_about_body_text">An L-system or Lindenmayer system is a parallel rewriting system and a type of formal grammar. An L-system consists of an alphabet of symbols that can be used to make strings, a collection of production rules that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, an initial &quot;axiom&quot; string from which to begin construction, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. L-systems were introduced and developed in 1968 by Aristid Lindenmayer, a Hungarian theoretical biologist and botanist at the University of Utrecht. Lindenmayer used L-systems to describe the behaviour of plant cells and to model the growth processes of plant development. L-systems have also been used to model the morphology of a variety of organisms[1] and can be used to generate self-similar fractals such as iterated function systems.</string>

    <string name="help_stochastic_body_text">Lindenmayer Systems are used to render plants. While plants are self-similar, they also grow randomly. The random grows is simulated with stochastic algorithms. More than one replacement rule can match the same character. One of these rules is picked at random. You can draw down on the screen to refresh the drawing. Example: \'f\' -> \'f+f\' and \'f\' -> \'f-f\'. The turtle will go half the time left and half the time right.</string>
