/**
 * Optimized implementation of {@see RenderAsyncTask}. Fractals are repeating. In processing a fractal,
 * this can be utlized for fast speed and low memory consumption. Say if a substitution creates
 * a certain pattern, future iterations will repeat the same pattern. Rather than compute them
 * each time, the pattern can be cached.
 *
 * Say an axiom has multiple 'f' instructions. This first iteration 'f' will get more complicated
 * with each iteration. When the final fractal is computed, we only need to compute the result of
 * the first 'f'. Then, we can use the result of that complex 'f' for all the other complex 'f's
 * of the initial axiom. Also, when we look at the first iteration of the 'f', we only need to
 * compute that slightly less complex 'f' once. In essence, we only need to compute what one
 * 'f' looks like at each iteration level. This makes the problem that would grow with
 * exponential complexity a problem of linear complexity.
 *
 * The limitation is that the approach doesn't work for certain instructions. For example, pushing
 * the current turtle location to the stack won't work. Also stochastic systems won't work because
 * each 'f' can be randomized.
